## 🧮 DAX Measures & Calculations

### 📆 Calendar Table:
```DAX
CalendarTable = 
ADDCOLUMNS (
    CALENDAR (MINX (Sales, Sales[OrderDate]), MAXX (Sales, Sales[OrderDate])),
    "Year", YEAR([Date]),
    "Month", FORMAT([Date], "MMMM"),
    "Month Number", MONTH([Date]),
    "Quarter", "Q" & FORMAT([Date], "Q"),
    "Weekday", FORMAT([Date], "dddd"),
    "Weekday Number", WEEKDAY([Date])
)
```

### 📐 Calculated Measures:
```DAX
1. Avg Sales per Order = [Total Sales] / DISTINCTCOUNT('Superstore Sales Dataset'[Order ID])

2. Monthly Sales = TOTALMTD([Total Sales], 'Superstore Sales Dataset'[Order Date])

3. Sales Year Growth = 
VAR CurrentYearSales = [Total Sales]
VAR PreviousYearSales = CALCULATE([Total Sales], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Superstore Sales Dataset'[Order Date]))
RETURN IF(
    NOT ISBLANK(PreviousYearSales),
    (CurrentYearSales - PreviousYearSales) / PreviousYearSales,
    BLANK()
)

4. Total Orders = COUNT('Superstore Sales Dataset'[Order ID])

5. Total Sales = SUM('Superstore Sales Dataset'[Sales])

6. Unique Customers = DISTINCTCOUNT('Superstore Sales Dataset'[Customer ID])
```
